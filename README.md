# N-Body-Simulator

Simulates the movement of objects through space. No force other than the gravitational pull of the other bodies is taken into account
within this model. The brute force method for implementing an N-body simulation has a runtime complexity of O(N^2), in order to reduce the
runtime complexity this simulator makes use of the The Barnes-Hut Algorithm. The Barnes-Hut Algorithm, utilizes the divide and conquer
methodology of programming and effectively reduces the runtime complexity to O(NlogN).

## Functionality

### Creating new bodies

To create a new body simply click the screen. More control over the creation of bodies is available to the users. To select the size of the
new body use the range input on the top left of the screen. To set the new body's velocity click and drag the mouse a bit!

To reset the universe (app) hit the escape key.

#####Practice makes perfect!
